# Design System Workspace

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate how to build a [React] application using a monorepo. [Yarn] is used to manage dependencies. The app module uses [Create React App] and the component module uses [Stencil].

## Getting Started

From the project root run `yarn`

### Running the React application

The application can be ran using the same command from either the application root or the **modules/react-app** folder. You can read more about the commands available for the app [here](modules/react-app).

From the project root, run `yarn start` in your terminal.

### Running the component playground

From the **modules/ds-components** directory, run `yarn start` in your terminal.

## Dependencies

[React] - a JavaScript library for building user interfaces

[Yarn] - a package manager for your code

[Stencil] - a zero-config CLI for TypeScript package development

[Material Web Components] - A set of ready to use rich text editors
